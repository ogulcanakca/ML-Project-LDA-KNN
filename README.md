# ML-Project-LDA-KNN
In order to implement linear discreament analysis (LDA) on the iris dataset, the algorithm was designed based on mathematical operations and classification was performed. In order to compare the results, LDA was implemented on the dataset with a ready-made library and then incorporated with the KNN algorithm and the results were observed.
